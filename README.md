**Overview**

This repository includes an ERTMS/ETCS moving block model developed by means of Simulink R2017b, 
together with an HTML file representing the model, and automatically generated through 
Simulink Report Generator R2017b. The model was developed in the context of the ASTRail EU Project.
For more information, see: http://www.astrail.eu

To run the model you should have MATLAB installed, together with Simulink.
The model, developed with MATLAB R2017b, should be compatible with the most 
recent versions of MATLAB.

**Running the model**

1. Unpack the moving-block-model-ASTRail.zip file
2. Double-click the moving_block_decomposed_msg_train.slx file: the model should appear in a Simulink panel
3. From the MATLAB framework, double-click ASTRail_msg_bus.mat (to load the bus definition)
4. Press the simulation button in the Simulink panel

**Visualising the model documentation**

1. Download the file named simulink-default-ASTRail.html
2. Download the folder named simulink-default-ASTRail_html_files
3. Make sure that simulink-default-ASTRail.html and the folder simulink-default-ASTRail_html_files are in the same folder.
3. Double-clock on simulink-default-ASTRail.html: the HTML page representing the model should appear in your browser.
